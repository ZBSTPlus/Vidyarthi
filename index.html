            don't align with their interests or abilities, leading to dissatisfaction and underperformance.

                Sir always encouraged us to explore the world beyond textbooks and his way of linking the academic
                topics with the current events across the world made the classes doubly interesting.
                Sir is a wonderful teacher, mentor and guide to any student and I'm lucky to be one among them!
